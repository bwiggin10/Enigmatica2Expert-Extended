  > * Construct 100 or more portals with negligible server TPS impact.

- ### ‚ú® Enhanced Block Replacement Mechanic
  > Blocks retain their state during replacement ‚Äî stone stairs become Nether Brick stairs, preserving their orientation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Customize portal spread settings such as maximum radius in the `scripts/do/portal_spread/config.zs` file.

![Configuration preview](https://i.imgur.com/dAutk0j.png)

You can also modify these values from any other script in your `scripts/` folder. Remember to set a high `#priority` value.

```swift
// Priority lower than config.zs but higher than any other scripts in portal_spread/
#priority 4400

import scripts.do.portal_spread.config.Config;

// Set the default maximum radius for portal spread
Config.defaultRadius = 32;

// Increase the portal spread speed by a factor of four
Config.spreadDelay = 0.25;
```

### üìñ JEI Recipe Integration

To add JEI recipe support, refer to the instructions in the header comment of the `scripts/do/portal_spread/requious.zs` file. This will enable players to view both default and custom recipes directly within the JEI interface, streamlining their gameplay experience.

### üõ†Ô∏è Custom Recipe Creation

Adding custom recipes to your portal spread is straightforward. Begin by importing the `spread` class instance from `scripts.do.portal_spread.recipes.spread` and utilize the `set()` or `setAll()` functions:

- **`set(dimFrom, dimTo, blockFrom, blocksTo, fallback = null)`**
  - `dimFrom`: The dimension ID from which the portal originates.
  - `dimTo`: The dimension ID to which the portal leads.
  - `blockFrom`: The block state(s) to be converted. Requires an exact match.
  - `blocksTo`: An array of potential output block states. Each subsequent block has a roughly 1/3 chance compared to the previous one. For example, `[A, B]` results in `A` 75% of the time and `B` 25% of the time. A list like `[A, B, C, D]` would distribute as `[44%, 31%, 19%, 6%]`.
  - `fallback`: An array of fallback block states used if `blocksTo` is empty or contains only `null` values. This is useful for cross-modpack compatibility, defaulting to vanilla blocks when certain mods are not installed.

- **`setAll([same params as set()])`**
  - Functions similarly to `set()`, but matches based on BlockID rather than exact `IBlockState`. For instance, `<blockstate:minecraft:stone>` matches Stone as well as its variants like Diorite and Andesite.

**üõà Notes:**

- Both `set()` and `setAll()` methods can be chained, e.g., `spread.set([...]).setAll([...]);`.
- Use `setNether([...])` and `setNetherAll([...])` for convenience functions that default `dimFrom` and `dimTo` to `0` and `-1` respectively, representing Vanilla *Overworld* to *The Nether* portals.

**üß™ Example:**

```ts
import scripts.do.portal_spread.recipes.spread;

spread

// Convert various Overworld terrain blocks into Netherrack and Quartz Ore
.setAllNether([
  <blockstate:minecraft:grass>,
  <blockstate:minecraft:dirt>,
  <blockstate:minecraft:farmland>,
  <blockstate:minecraft:stone>,
], [
  <blockstate:minecraft:netherrack>,
  <blockstate:minecraft:quartz_ore>,
])

// Convert only Mossy Cobblestone into Magma
.setAllNether([
  <blockstate:minecraft:mossy_cobblestone>,
], [<blockstate:minecraft:magma>])

// Maintain slab properties when converting Stone Slabs to Nether Brick Slabs
.setNether([
  <blockstate:minecraft:stone_slab:half=bottom,variant=stone_brick>,
  <blockstate:minecraft:stone_slab:half=bottom,variant=stone>,
], [<blockstate:minecraft:stone_slab:half=bottom,variant=nether_brick>])
.setNether([
  <blockstate:minecraft:stone_slab:half=top,variant=stone_brick>,
  <blockstate:minecraft:stone_slab:half=top,variant=stone>,
], [<blockstate:minecraft:stone_slab:half=top,variant=nether_brick>])
;
```

#### Helper stick

Creating custom recipes is a breeze with the in-game recipe editor. While in creative mode, use the following command to obtain a special stick for recipe creation:

```d
/give @p stick 1 0 {}
```

- Hold `[Shift]` and `[Right-click]` to select one or multiple **input** block states.
- Simply `[Right-click]` to select one or multiple **output** block states.
- `[Left-click]` to **finalize** the recipe by adding the block as an output.

The newly created recipe will be output to the `crafttweaker.log` file. You can then incorporate it into the `scripts/do/portal_spread/recipes.zs` file or any other script within your `scripts/` directory.
