/*

It seems that due to the fact that the my_precious-1.12.2-v2hf1 has
been ported from newer versions of MC, its model initialization
code only works in vanilla 1.12.2, without some mods.
This file is one of the 3 parts of the fix that
1. Delete the old initialization method
2. Create a separate initialization
3. Correctly assign resourceLocation
