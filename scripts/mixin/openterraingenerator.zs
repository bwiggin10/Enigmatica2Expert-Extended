/*
üåç Fix: OTG worlds with the removed "Void" dimension preset can now be launched properly.

This is an E2EE-exclusive patch. In early versions of E2EE, the "Void" preset was added to test
OTG features for a future Skyblock dimension. Later, the Dimension 3 (Void Skyblock world) was
migrated to be handled by the JustEnoughDimensions mod. However, if a world was originally
created with OTG, OTG would still attempt to manage Dim3 using its own code.

This issue did not occur if the server or client created a non-OTG world. However, when both
Overworld and Skyblock players were hosted on the same server, OTG would claim Dim3 for itself,
preventing Nether portals from being lit properly.
