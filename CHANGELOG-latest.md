  > Extra Utilities 2's terraformer confuses many, the most common thing being misunderstanding of TF/climagraph requirements. This causes players to waste resources on making many parts, when the terraformer only needs one of each.
  > 
  > This change removes mentions of TF energy from Terraformer's GUI and replaces it with "work/doesn't work" symbolling.

  > - Lower general warp gain from thaumcraft researches
  >   > Due to large amount of thaumcraft addons, there are lot of researches that provides warp. Overall this warp  accumulates to amount not balanced for vanilla thaumcraft gameplay. That means even when clearing normal warp the amount of permament warp is high enough to trigger all warp events.
